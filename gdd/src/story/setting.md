# Setting

The game takes place in a frontier town in the desert on the edge of complicated ruins.

There is an unfamiliar magic system, called alchemy, which is inspired by the alchemy in full-metal alchemist, and
which I should probably think more about. Alchemy is used as a major source of technological advancement in society,
and is largely considered a valuable but common thing which established communities have access to.

The associated "industrial revolution" occurred some time ago. The technological level is intended to be nearish
to the American 1800s, and inspired somewhat by the "wild west" stereotype of a frontier town. Because of the unknown
qualities of alchemy we can toss in, or remove, whatever technology is needed or needed-to-be-absent to serve the plot.

The town itself should be somewhat hard, but charming. The people are busy and vibrant, at first, although they are
suffering from various problems (see the story progression chapter). Government here is loosely organized and ad hoc.

The town is the main "hub" of the game, and is the main source of speaking NPCs. Ongoing relationships with NPCs should
be able to be developed.

The faraway government is, in some sense, paying for all this, and is quite a bit more consolidated and organized. They
are initially friendly but militaristic; they are not to be denied. The question of whether the government is elected,
inherited, seized, etc. is never discussed. It is out there, mostly far away, and it is a force beyond what you can
seriously oppose for any length of time, if its full attention were focused on you.

The ruins are mysterious. On the way into town you will see small fragments which can be investigated, although the
doors are locked and the writing is unintelligible.

Inside the ruins ... (TODO)
