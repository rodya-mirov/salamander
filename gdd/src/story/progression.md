# Story Progression

In the beginning, ruins out in the desert have been discovered that are of great interest, and a small frontier
town has risen up around them. You are one of the explorers who has traveled from the capital to try and see what
it's about.

Traveling through desert canyons functions as a tutorial, introducing basic mechanics and establishing setting
with various minor discoverables to give a preview of the ruins.

At the end of the sequence of canyons, you arrive at the town, which functions as the main hub of the game. Depending
on your class, you go to some kind of guild which gives you some initial set of equipment and start the skill trees.
After gathering some initial quest(s?) you head out into the desert to explore the ruins.

Periodic trips into the ruins reveal more of the story and setting, including insight into the language, which gradually
allow the player to decipher text on the ruins and discover what destroyed the original civilization.

As the game progresses, a series of threats become apparent:

 - Environmental devastation from the original civilization is still relevant and dangerous. This explains the desert
environment nearby, and is causing rampant illness, physical and mental, in the town.
 - The magic system (alchemy) is revealed to be the root cause of the desertification and the illness, as it functions
by sucking the life force out of nearby living things.
 - Systems in the ruins have been present but deactivated; the arrival of people in the town has given them enough
mana (rename this) to reactivate automatically.
 - This revelation is largely met with denial and defensiveness within the town (somewhat) and farther away (a lot).
 - Eventually the capital determines the ruins are an important source of wealth and military strength and send an army
to seize it and the town.

The ruins also become more complex as the game proceeds:

- Nonsense text eventually separates into intelligible words as the character's language skills improve
- Player begins by scavenging around the edges of ruins, or breaking inside to exposed entraces; eventually
learns to gain access properly and sees ruins inside.
- Exterior is mostly sand-blasted metal and rock with mysterious signage
- Interior is the ruins of civilization, including a variety of things:
  - Residential apartments; basically like an apartment building with rooms and corridors
  - Military installations; some machinery is still active and dangerous / potentially profitable
  - Dead parks; you can see the desiccated ruins of what was once a lively and beautiful space

Knowledge and exploration leads directly to new powers available to the player, which in turn lead to more quest lines
and more exploration.

At the end the player must eventually decide what they will do, and can achieve some good, but cannot save the world,
because the core problems are unsolvable. Their options revolve around:

- Politics -- what to do about the invading army and the associated government
- The Ruins -- whether to seal, destroy, or activate the latent technology inside
- Alchemy -- to what extent to expand its use or try and undermine it (but it cannot be stamped out)
- The Town -- to what extent the town, and the people inside, will be destroyed, protected, or enriched
