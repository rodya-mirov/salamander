# Endings

Not all "ending" actions will be available to all players. Details are to be determined but for instance:

One possible action is to defend the townsfolk by hiding them in an impervious shelter in the ruins and sealing the doors.
This has interactions with the above axes, and may not be available as an option:

- If the player entered the shelter destructively, it will no longer be impervious
- If the player lacks the technical skill to operate the systems, it will not be able to be sealed correctly
- If the player lacks the charisma + relationships in the town, few will follow them into shelter
- This is a bad solution for the town; they're essentially trapped; but it's better than dying
- This is a bad solution for the army; they're free to pillage what they can and expand their power
- This seems to not progress ecological destruction, but not really slow it down either
- It's sort of put your head in the sand and try to survive choice, and there are worse options

Another possible action is to defeat the invading army by activating the technology in the ruins.
This has interactions with the above axes, and may not be available as an option:

- If the player destroyed the relevant systems, they will not be available
- If the player lacks the technical skill to operate the systems, it will not be able to be sealed correctly
- If the player lacks the charisma + relationships in the town, they may not trust the player and may be killed in the crossfire
- This is a questionable solution for the town; they survive but have no central government to rely on, and have to make do in the desert
- This is a questionable solution for the army; the government is hindered, but they had no change of heart and will continue to use the existing technology and probably become like the original civilization
- This is an okay solution for the environment; the systems are activated, which is bad, but they're not spreading, which is good

Another possible action is to cause the ruins to self destruct, killing the town, the invading army, and all the
knowledge contained therein.

- The player only needs to have discovered the relevant options and not destroy them
- This is a decent solution for the army; they can't get anything from the ruins and won't expand their use of alchemy
- This is a decent solution for the environment; no expansion occurred, and it will discourage further use for a while, because it's so obviously dangerous
- This is the worst possible solution for the town obviously
- Ending as brief as possible -- "If we sacrificed all this, then ... who did we save?" fade out

Another possible option is to somehow destroy the ruins without destroying the town, and still defeat the army in combat.

- Requires extensive knowledge of the ruins
- Requires extensive combat abilities + trust with the town
- etc.

Another possible option is to somehow destroy the ruins without destroying the town, and just ... die in combat

Another possible option is to somehow destroy the ruins without destroying the town, and make peace with the army somehow

Another possible option is to just make peace with the army by ... being subservient and helpful, and assisting them
into the ruins.

Another possible option is just to completely fail at all of that and then being overrun by overwhelming enemy forces.

More endings should exist as well, depending on the player's skills and choices.

It should also be possible to just have no good options:

- With insufficient trust established in the town, it will be difficult to get any kind of collective action going,
and they will likely side with the government or die in combat.
- With insufficient understanding of the ruins, it will be difficult to use it or destroy it or hide in it.
- With insufficient combat skills, fighting your way out will fail
  - Note -- this is hard to communicate to the player that they shouldn't just save / reload until they "win"
    so it should probably be in cutscene form.
- With insufficient relationships with the government, negotiation will fail and no peaceful options will exist

But the player shouldn't get to the end without any good options unless they've been willfully negligent; the game
should make it fairly clear they're fucking up. It's not a good feeling.
