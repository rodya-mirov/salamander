# Theme

This is a game about systems breaking down that can't be repaired. This is a game about frustration, and confusion,
and loss; and it is a game about the inevitability of these things.

It is also a game about struggling and winning meaningful victories. It is a game where people are flawed but they
are worth helping.

Throughout the game the conflict should revolve around the following themes:

- **[Environmentalism]** People depend on the things that are destroying them.
- **[Misinformation / Confusion]** People are easily tricked, especially when the truth is frightening or inconvenient.
- **[Common Kindness]** People are often good, despite their flaws, and are worth saving.
- **[No Simple Answer]** There is no a cheap way out; we cannot proceed as we were before.
