Improvements:
- Maybe a little artificial inertia for player / NPC movement, to make it feel a little more natural
- Make shadow a circle (maybe use a sprite, maybe there's a programmatic way to do this)
- Improve asset loading reuse, this is not scalable
- Improve z-layering (based on y-position at root, I guess? Maybe a custom component?)

Next features???
